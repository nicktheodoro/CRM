# CRM

Welcome to the Simple CRM project! This is a work-in-progress project aimed at creating a straightforward Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The project utilizes modern technologies such as Vue 2 with Vuetify UI for the frontend and .NET 8 with Entity Framework for the backend.

## Overview

The Simple CRM project leverages Domain-Driven Design (DDD) on the backend and Clean Architecture on the frontend. This architectural approach helps in building scalable, maintainable, and modular applications.

### Technologies Involved

- **Vue.js 2**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces.
- **Vuetify**: A Material Design component framework for Vue.js.
- **.NET 8**: A cross-platform framework for building various types of applications.
- **Entity Framework**: An object-relational mapper for .NET that simplifies database interactions.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication.
- **Vuex**: A state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications.
- **Clean Architecture**: A software design philosophy that separates concerns into layers.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: An approach to software development that prioritizes the domain model.
